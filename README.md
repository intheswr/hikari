accurate osu! name checker.

# instructions
first off, download the latest release for your preferred platform, and extract whereever you wish.

to use this, you'll need to obtain both your osu! session token and your xsrf token.

you will find these two tokens by opening developer tools (F12 on your keyboard) and heading to the "storage" tab.
clicking on "Cookies" and opening the "osu.ppy.sh" tab will reveal both of these values. double click on the value section of each token, and paste them into their respective place in the "config.yaml" file.

you will then need to add your own word list under the file name "lists.txt"
